# ProtoShade
A GLSL:ES Shader Prototyping Utility for Android

ProtoShade is a fragment (pixel) shader prototyping and design utility for the OpenGL ES Shading Language, with an emphasis on rasterizer special effects design, to differentiate from existing "viewport-sized quadrangle" fragment shader design utilities.

The user might use the application to prototype lighting algorithms, or to design unique special effects which are projected onto a three-dimensional model. The program supplies four example shader programs, and five models.
